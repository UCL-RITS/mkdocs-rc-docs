# Contact and Support

Users should direct any queries relating to their use of Research
Computing services to the Research Computing Support Team at 
<rc-support@ucl.ac.uk> (see below). The team will respond to your question as
quickly as possible, giving priority to requests that are deemed urgent
on the basis of the information provided.

**Availability:** 9:30am - 4:30pm, Monday - Friday, except on Bank
Holidays and College Closures.

We aim to provide to you with a useful response within 24 hours.

**Please do not email individuals unless you are explicitly asked to do
so; always use the rc-support email address provided as this is the best way for your request to be processed.**

## Drop-In Sessions

ARC holds in-person drop-in sessions roughly every two weeks which at least one member of the Research Computing team usually attends, and weekly online sessions. More details and dates for these sessions are available on [the ARC website](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/arc/community-events/drop-sessions).

If you have a particularly complex problem, it may be useful to email the support address, <rc-support@ucl.ac.uk>, beforehand so that the person attending can prepare.

## Location

The Research Computing Team are located at:

> 38-50 Bidborough Street
> Floor 3
> London
> WC1H 9BT

We are keen to collaborate and welcome visitors to our offices to talk about all things research computing.
However, we do not operate a walk-up service desk: if you are frustrated by slow response to a support ticket, we are sorry but please do not send reminders as there is probably a good reason why your request is not being processed.
