# Data Science Platform

## Overview
The data science platform provides users with access to tools supporting data science workflows via the web browser. Current components of this service include:

* [RStudio Server] (02-rstudio-access.md)
* [Jupyter Lab](04-jupyter.md)

The main aim of this service is to support teaching and the service should not be used for computationally intensive research.
