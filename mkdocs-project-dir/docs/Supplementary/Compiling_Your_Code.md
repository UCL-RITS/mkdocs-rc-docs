# Compiling Your Code

## Download your code

Use wget or curl to download the source code for the software you want
to install to your account. There might be binaries available, but they
often won't work on our clusters because they were compiled for other
machines with other library versions available. Use tar or unzip or
similar depending on archive type to uncompress your source code.

```
wget https://www.example.com/program.tar.gz
tar -xvf program.tar.gz
```

You won't be able to use a package manager like yum, you'll need to
follow the manual installation instructions for a user-space install
(not using sudo).

## Set up your modules

Before you start compiling, you need to make sure you have the right
compilers, libraries and other tools available for your software. If you
haven't changed anything, you will have the default modules loaded.

Check what the instructions for your software tell you about compiling
it. If the website doesn't say much, the source code will hopefully have
a `README` or `INSTALL` file.

You may want to use a different compiler - the default is the Intel
compiler.

`module avail compilers` will show you all the compiler modules
available. Most Open Source software tends to assume you're using GCC
and OpenMPI (if it uses MPI) and is most tested with that combination,
so if it doesn't specify you may want to begin there (do check what the
newest modules available are):

```
module unload compilers mpi mkl
module load compilers/gnu/4.9.2  
module load mpi/openmpi/1.10.1/gnu-4.9.2
```

## Available compilers

The following compilers are available and supported on our clusters:

  - Intel C, C++ and Fortran
  - GNU C, C++ and Fortran

We currently have a limited number of licenses for the Intel compilers
so only a certain number of users can use them simultaneously. This
means that your compilation may fail with an error complaining about not
being able to obtain a valid license. If this happens, simply wait for a
few minutes and try again.

In addition to the supported tools, there are a number of tools
installed on our clusters which are not supported (for example the PGI
compilers) which were installed to build certain supported packages.
Users who use the unsupported packages do so at their own risk.

## Build systems

Most software will use some kind of build system to manage how files are
compiled and linked and in what order. Here are a few common ones.

### Automake configure

[Automake](http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/automake.html)
will generate the Makefile for you and hopefully pick up sensible
options through configuration. You can give it an install prefix to tell
it where to install (or you can build it in place and not use make
install at all).

```
./configure --prefix=/home/username/place/you/want/to/install  
make  
# if it has a test suite, good idea to use it  
make test   
make install
```

If it has more configuration flags, you can use `./configure --help` to
view them.

Usually configure will create a config.log: you can look in there to
find if any tests have failed or things you think should have been
picked up haven't.

### CMake

[CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) is another build system. It will have a
CMakeFile or the instructions will ask you to use cmake or ccmake rather
than make. It also generates Makefiles for you. `ccmake` is a
terminal-based interactive interface where you can see what variables
are set to and change them, then repeatedly configure until everything
is correct, generate the Makefile and quit. `cmake` is the commandline
version. The process tends to go like
this:

```
ccmake CMakeLists.txt  
# press c to configure - will pick up some options  
# press t to toggle advanced options  
# keep making changes and configuring until no more errors or changes  
# press g to generate and exit  
make  
# if it has a test suite, good idea to use it  
make test   
make install
```

If you need to rerun ccmake and reconfigure, remember to delete the
`CMakeCache.txt` file, or you'll be wondering why your changes haven't taken.
Turning on verbose Makefiles in ccmake is also useful if your code
didn't compile first time - you'll be able to see what flags the
compiler or linker is actually being given when it fails.

### Make

Your code may just come with a Makefile and have no configure, in which
case the generic way to compile it is as follows:

```
make targetname
```

There's usually a default target, which `make` on its own will use. If
you need to change any configuration options, you'll need to edit those
sections of the Makefile (at the top, where the variables/flags are
defined).

Here are some typical variables you may want to change in a Makefile.

These are what compilers/mpi wrappers to use - these are also defined by
the compiler modules, so you can see what they should be. Intel would be
`icc`, `icpc`, `ifort`, for example. If it's a program that can be compiled
using MPI and only has a variable for `CC`, then set that to `mpicc`.

```
CC=gcc  
CXX=g++  
FC=gfortran  
MPICC=mpicc  
MPICXX=mpicxx  
MPIF90=mpif90
```

CFLAGS and LDFLAGS are flags for the compiler and linker respectively,
and there might be LIBS or INCLUDE as well. When linking a library with
the name libfoo, use `-lfoo`.

```
CFLAGS="-I/path/to/include"  
LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/foo/lib -L/path/to/bar/lib"  
LDLIBS="-lfoo -lbar"
```

Remember to `make clean` first if you are recompiling with new options\!

## BLAS and LAPACK

BLAS and LAPACK are provided as part of MKL, OpenBLAS or ATLAS. There
are several different OpenBLAS and ATLAS modules on Legion for different
compilers. MKL is available in the Intel compiler module.

Your code may try to link `-lblas -llapack`: this isn't the right way to
use BLAS and LAPACK with MKL or ATLAS (our OpenBLAS now has symlinks
that allow you to do this).

## Set your PATH and other environment variables

After you have installed your software, you'll need to add it to your
`PATH` environment variable so you can run it without having to give the
full path to its location.

Put this in your `~/.bashrc` file so it will set this with every new session you
create. Replace username with your username and point to the directory
your binary was built in (frequently `program/bin`). This adds it to the
front of your PATH, so if you install a newer version of something, it
will be found before the system one.

```
export PATH=/home/username/location/of/software/binary:$PATH
```

If you built a library that you'll go on to compile other software with,
you probably want to also add the lib directory to your
LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH and LIBRARY\_PATH, and the include directory to CPATH
(add export statements as above). This may mean your configure step will
pick your library up correctly without any further effort on your part.

To make these changes to your .bashrc take effect in your current
session:

```
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Python

There are `python2/recommended` and `python3/recommended` bundles. These
use a virtualenv and have pip set up for you. They both have numpy and
scipy available.

### Set compiler module

The Python versions on Myriad were built with GCC. You can run them with
the default Intel compilers loaded because everything depends on the
gcc-libs/4.9.2 module. When you are building your own Python packages
you should have the GCC compiler module loaded however, to avoid the
situation where you build a package with the Intel compiler and then try
to run it with GCC, in which case it will be unable to find
Intel-specific instructions.

```
module unload compilers
module load compilers/gnu/4.9.2
```

If you get an error like this when trying to run something, recheck what
compiler you used.

```
undefined symbol: __intel_sse2_strrchr
```

### Install your own packages in the same virtualenv

This will use our central virtualenv, which contains a number of
packages already installed.

```
pip install --user <python2pkg>  
pip3 install --user <python3pkg>
```

These will install into `.python2local` or `.python3local` directories in your home directory, respectively.

To see what is already installed, the [Python-shared list](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/rcps-buildscripts/blob/master/lists/python-shared.list)
shows what is installed for both Python2 and 3, while the [Python2 list](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/rcps-buildscripts/blob/master/lists/python-2.list)
and [Python3 list](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/rcps-buildscripts/blob/master/lists/python-3.list)
show what is only installed for one or the other. (There may also be
prereqs that aren't listed explicitly - pip will tell you if something
is already installed as long as you have the recommended module bundle
loaded).

### Use your own virtualenvs

If you need different packages that are not compatible with the central
installs, you can create a new virtualenv and only yours will be
available.

```
virtualenv <DIR> 
source <DIR>/bin/activate
```

Your bash prompt will show you that a different virtualenv is active.

### Installing via setup.py

If you need to install using setup.py, you can use the `--user` flag and
as long as one of the python bundles is loaded, it will install into the
same `.python2local` or `.python3local` as pip and you won't need to add
any new paths to your environment.

```
python setup.py install --user
```

You can alternatively use `--prefix` in which case you will have to set
the install prefix to somewhere in your space, and also set PYTHONPATH
and PATH to include your install location. Some installs won't create
the prefix directory for you, in which case create it first. This is
useful if you want to keep this package entirely separate and only in
your paths on demand.

```
export PYTHONPATH=/home/username/your/path/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH  
# if necessary, create install path  
mkdir -p home/username/your/path/lib/python2.7/site-packages  
python setup.py install --prefix=/home/username/your/path

# add these to your .bashrc or jobscript  
export PYTHONPATH=/home/username/your/path/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH  
export PATH=/home/username/your/path/bin:$PATH
```

Check that the PATH is where your Python executables were installed, and
the PYTHONPATH is correct. It will tend to tell you at install time if
you need to change or create the PYTHONPATH directory.

### Python script executable paths

If you have an executable python script giving the location of python
like this, and it fails because that python doesn't exist in that
location or isn't the one that has the additional packages installed:

```
#!/usr/bin/python2.7
```

You should change it so it uses the first python found in your
environment. 

```
#!/usr/bin/env python 
```

## Perl

Perl modules will freqently have a Makefile.PL (especially if you
download the tar files from CPAN.org yourself). You can install manually
as:

```
perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/username/your/perl/location
make
make install
```

### CPAN

You can use CPAN to download and install modules locally for you. The
first time you run the `cpan` command, it will create a `.cpan`
directory for you and ask you to give it configuration settings or allow
it to set them automatically.

You need to tell it where you want your install prefix to be.

If it is automatically configured, you need to edit these lines in your
`.cpan/CPAN/MyConfig.pm`, for example if you want it to be in a lib
directory in your home (change username to your own username):

```perl
'make_install_arg' => q[PREFIX=/home/username/lib],
 # other lines in here  
'makepl_arg' => q[PREFIX=/home/username/lib],
'mbuild_install_arg' => q[PREFIX=/home/username/lib],
'mbuildpl_arg' => q[--install_base /home/username/lib],
```

It will download and build modules inside .cpan and install them where
you specified.

### Set PERL5LIB paths

If you install your own Perl or Perl modules, you will need to append
them to your PERL5LIB:

```
export PERL5LIB=/home/username/your/perl/location:$PERL5LIB
```

If you installed with CPAN, you may need to add several paths to this
based on the layout it creates inside your nominated Perl directory.

### Errors when using non-default Perl versions

#### warnings.pm

If you are using a version of Perl that is not the default system Perl
and get strange errors when trying to run a Perl script, particularly
ones about
warnings.pm:

```
Search pattern not terminated at /shared/ucl/apps/perl/5.20.0/lib/5.20.0/warnings.pm line 1099
```

then you need to edit the script so that instead of beginning with
`#!/usr/bin/perl`, it begins with `#!/usr/bin/env perl`. Otherwise it
will try to use the old system Perl libraries with your newer Perl
executable, which won't work.

#### libperl.so not found

You probably built perl without telling it to build the shared library
too. Add `-Duseshrplib` to your build flags.


## R

There are instructions on installing and using local R packages in
[Using your own R packages](../Software_Guides/R.md#using_your_own_r_packages).

## Compiling with MPI

OpenMPI and Intel MPI are available. Certain programs do not work well
with one or the other, so if you are having problems try the other one.
Intel MPI is based on MPICH, so if the program you are compiling
mentions that, try Intel MPI first.

The Intel MPI is threadsafe; some versions of OpenMPI aren't.

Note that OpenMPI 1.8.4 had a segv bug in non-blocking collectives that
is fixed in OpenMPI 1.10.1.

## Enabling OpenMP

To enable OpenMP with the Intel compilers, you simply need to add
`-openmp` to your compile line. With the GNU compilers you need to add
`-fopenmp`.

## Problems

If you experience problems building your applications, please contact
your local IT support in the first instance. We are available at
rc-support AT ucl.ac.uk to help you if you still cannot build your app
or if you need to report a problem with our software stack.
