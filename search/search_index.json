The other has been detected as failing soon and is being copied to a spare, but     this is happening slowly, likely because the disk is failing.</p> <p>They are in separate volumes so there isn't a risk there, but it can take some time for  reconstruction to complete and this will make the filesystem sluggish. This will affect you  accessing files on the login nodes, and also your jobs reading or writing to files on Scratch  or home, and accessing our centrally-installed software.

There was a cooling issue that affected only the admin rack this      time which consists of admin, util and login nodes plus the Lustre storage.

UCL Estates      know the cause of the problem and so hopefully this should not happen again for the time being.</p> </li> <li> <p>2023-03-23 03:20 - Young's single running OSS went down due to high load and was brought back up     shortly before 9am. The second OSS had lost both internal drives and is likely to take several more     days before it can be brought back into service, so we are still running at risk.</p> </li> <li> <p>2023-03-24 09:00 - Young's single running OSS went down again overnight. Last night we appeared to      be running into a new ZFS issue, where we had a kernel panic, a reboot and a failure to start ZFS      resources. Our Infrastructure team brought the resources back up this morning and Lustre recovery      began, but now the OSS has become unresponsive again. This means that you will not be able to log in      at the moment and jobs will have failed because they haven't been able to access the filesystem. </p> </li> <li> <p>2023-03-24 13:00 - We do not currently expect to be able to bring everything up again until after      the weekend. Right now there is very high memory usage on the existing OSS even when only the util      and login nodes are running Lustre clients and all the compute nodes are off. We aren't sure why. </p> <p>Next week we may need to delay bringing the compute back up until after the other OSS is fully fixed, but we will update you on this then.</p> <p>Sorry about this, we were running ok on one OSS until Thursday and now something is preventing us  from continuing like that, so we may have another underlying problem.</p> </li> <li> <p>2023-03-27 11:00 - The disks in the Young OSSes will be replaced tomorrow (we had another      failure in the OSS that is currently up, so it is down a disk again). This means that it will be      during Wednesday at the earliest that we're able to start jobs again, and it does depend somewhat      on how well everything is behaving after all the disks are replaced and we have a properly      resilient system again - we'll need to do some testing before allowing jobs to start even if      everything looks good.</p> </li> <li> <p>2023-03-28 17:15 - Young's filesystem is running on two OSSes again. Roughly half the compute nodes      are enabled and jobs are running on them. If all goes well, we'll switch on the rest of the compute      nodes tomorrow.</p> </li> <li> <p>2023-03-29 15:10 - Jobs were started on the rest of the nodes at around 10:30am and everything is      running ok with the exception of the GPU nodes. On the GPU nodes we are seeing Lustre client      evictions which cause I/O errors for jobs running on the nodes - they weren't able to complete      the read or write they were requesting. For now we aren't running jobs on the GPU nodes until we have      this sorted out. You may have a job that started running there earlier today or yesterday and failed      or did not create all the output expected because of this - please do check your output carefully in      that case.</p> <p>This is a new issue. We have some suspicions that it is configuration-related, since the GPU nodes  have two OmniPath cards each and Lustre is set up to use both. This setup was working previously; we  are going to investigate further.</p> </li> <li> <p>2023-03-30 10:40 - Last night we had two ZFS panics, one on each OSS. These occurred at just      before 10pm and again at 1:30am. These will have caused some jobs to fail with I/O errors. We have      adjusted some configuration so that if we have more panics then the filesystem should hopefully be      able to recover more quickly and cause fewer I/O errors.</p> <p>We had a problem with ZFS panics before where it was a known issue with the versions we were running  and fixed it by upgrading the versions of Lustre and ZFS that we had on Young. The current issue we  are experiencing does not appear to be a known one, investigation continues.</p> </li> <li> <p>2023-04-03 10:30 - Young stayed up over the weekend and was running CPU jobs successfully. We have      now re-enabled the GPU nodes as well.</p> <p>We are still getting some ZFS panics, but the change to how they work mean the filesystem is  failing over and recovering in time to only affect a few client connections. We are scanning for corrupted metadata and files since this may be the cause.</p> <p>We will be leaving Young up and running jobs over Easter. UCL's Easter closing is from Thurs 6 April  to Weds 12 April inclusive and we will be back on Thurs 13 April. If anything goes wrong during this  time, we won't be able to fix it until we are back.</p> </li> <li> <p>2023-04-04 14:20 - The <code>zfs scrub</code> we were running to look for corrupted metadata and files     has exposed a drive failure. We have spares and the affected ZFS pool is now recovering, which will      take a day or so. I/O performance may be degraded during the recovery. </p> </li> <li> <p>2023-06-21 16:30 - We had a filesystem issue caused by a failed disk in the metadata server      at about 4:30pm. We brought it back up and it was recovering at around 8:20pm and will have      been slower for a while overnight until recovery completed. Jobs will have failed in the      period when it was down, so please do check on things that were running during this time to      see whether they completed or not - our apologies for this.</p> </li> <li> <p>2023-06-27 20:15 - We\u2019ve had an unexpectedly high number of drive failures in Young\u2019s      filesystem, and this has created a significant risk of filesystem failure until we can replace      the drives and restore resiliency. </p> <p>To try to keep the filesystem running, we\u2019ve had to shut down the login and compute nodes,  terminating all running jobs and removing access to the cluster. This should massively  reduce the load on the filesystem, and allow us to more rapidly bring the system back to a  safe level of redundancy.</p> <p>In future, we will also attempt to keep more spare drives on-site, which should help us avoid  this kind of situation.</p> <p>Apologies for the inconvenience: we\u2019re going to be replacing drives and we will hopefully have  an update with better news tomorrow.</p> </li> <li> <p>2023-06-28 11:00 The situation with the disks in Young's filesystem is worse than we thought      and we're currently doing some data recovery procedures so we can then evaluate what we      should do next.</p> <p>Data in home directories is backed up. We have likely lost some data from Scratch but are  working to find out the implications of that, and what and how much could be affected.</p> <p>How long Young will be down depends on what we discover in the next few days. We will need  to do a full filesystem check once we have a recovered filesystem to check, and this can take  some time.</p> <p>The detail, for those who wish to know:</p> <p>A Lustre filesystem consists of object store servers and metadata servers, and the metadata  servers store information such as filenames, directories, access permissions, and file layout.</p> <p>We had a failed drive in a metadata mirror on Wednesday last week. We have eight mirrors in  that metadata target and each consists of two drives. We had a replacement drive arrive, but  before we could fit it, the second drive in the same mirror indicated that it was beginning to  fail. </p> <p>We fitted the replacement drive yesterday, but the rebuild of the mirror overnight did not  succeed and the failing disk's status degraded further. What we are going to do next is to  retrieve as much off the failing disk as we can, move it onto a healthy disk, and then see  what status the filesystem is in and what is in an inconsistent state. </p> <p>As was mentioned, we had also ordered more spare drives to keep on site but this happened  before those arrived.</p> <p>We're sorry for this situation and are working to address it. We'll keep you updated as we  know more.</p> </li> <li> <p>2023-06-29 11:30 - We've recovered what was on the failing disk and are missing approximately      250kB of metadata. (Since it is metadata, this doesn't directly translate to the effect on your     files, but we can probably be cautiously optimistic about the expected size of impact, should      nothing else go horribly wrong).</p> <p>Replacement disks are being sent to us and should arrive today or tomorrow.</p> <p>Once the disks arrive, we will proceed with the next step of moving the recovered data onto a  new disk and getting the filesystem to use that in replacement of the failed disk, and then we  can attempt to bring the filesystem up and see what status it thinks it is in. At that point we will have several levels of filesystem health checking to run.</p> <p>We are also progressing with some contingency plans relating to the backup data we have, to  make it easier to use should we need to. </p> <p>I've had a couple of questions about when Young will be back up - we don't know yet, but not  during next week. I would expect us to still be doing the filesystem recovery and checks on  the first couple of days of the week even if the disks do arrive today, so we probably won't  have any additional updates for you until midweek.</p> <p>It does take a long and unpredictable time to rebuild disks, check all the data, and recover  files: as an example, our metadata recovery was giving us estimates of 19 hours to 5 days while it was dealing with the most damaged portions of the disk. </p> </li> <li> <p>2023-07-04 10:25 - I just wanted to give you an update on our progress. The short version is      \"we are still working on it but now believe we have lost little to no user data\".</p> <p>We do not have an ETA for return to service but may be able to give you read-only access to  your files in the near future.</p> <p>More detail for those who are interested:</p> <p>We have fitted the replacement disks and migrated the data to the new drives.

Cluster A cluster consists of a set of computer nodes connected together over a fast local area network. A message passing protocol such as MPI allows individual nodes to work together as a single system. Core A core refers to a processing unit within a node. A node may have multiple cores which can work in parallel on a single task, operating on the same data in memory. This kind of parallelism is coordinated using the OpenMP library. Alternatively, cores may work independently on different tasks. Cores may or may not also share cache. Interconnect The interconnect is the network which is used to transfer data between nodes in a cluster. Different types of interconnect operate at different bandwidths and with different amounts of latency, which affects the suitability of a collection of nodes for jobs which use message passing (MPI). Job In the context of Batch Processing, a job refers to a computational task to be performed such as a single simulation or analysis. Job Script A job script is essentially a special kind of script used to specify the parameters of a job. Users can specify the data to input, program to use, and the computing resources required. The job script is specified when a job is submitted to SGE, which reads lines starting with <code>#$</code>. MPI The Message Passing Interface (MPI) system is a set of portable libraries which can be incorporated into programs in order to control parallel computation. Specifically it coordinates effort between nodes which do not share the same memory address space cf. OpenMP. Node In cluster computing, a node refers to a computational unit which is capable of operating independently of other parts of the cluster. As a minimum it consists of one (or more) processing cores, has its own memory, and runs its own operating system. OpenMP Open Multi-Processing. OpenMP supports multithreading, a process whereby a master thread generates a number of slave threads to run a task which is divided among them. OpenMP applies to processes running on shared memory platforms, i.e.  jobs running on a single node. Hybrid applications may make use of both OpenMP and MPI. Process A process is a single instance of a program that is running on a computer. A single process may consist of many threads acting concurrently, and there may multiple instances of a program running as separate processes. Script A shell script enables users to list commands to be run consecutively by typing them into a text file instead of typing them out live. The first line of the script uses the shebang notation <code>#!</code> to designate the scripting language interpreter program to be used to interpret the commands, e.g. bash. Shebang \"Shebang\" is a common abbreviation for \"hash-bang\" \u2014 the character sequence <code>#!</code> \u2014 which is placed at the start of a script to specify the interpreter that should be used. When the shebang is found in the first line of a script, the program loader reads the rest of the line as the path to the required interpreter (e.g. <code>/bin/bash</code> is the usual path to the bash shell). The specified interpreter is then run with the path to the script passed as an argument to it. Shell A command line interpreter which provides an interface for users to type instructions to be interpreted by the operating system and display output via the monitor. Users type specific shell commands in order to run processes, e.g. <code>ls</code> to list directory contents. Son of Grid Engine (SGE or SoGE) The queuing system used by many cluster computing systems (including, currently, all the ones we run) to organise and schedule jobs. Once jobs are submitted to SGE, it takes care of executing them when the required resources become available. Job priority is subject to the local fair use policy. Sun Grid Engine (SGE) The original software written by Sun Microsystems that was later modified to make Son of Grid Engine (among other products, like Univa Grid Engine). Documentation may refer to Sun Grid Engine instead of Son of Grid Engine, and for most user purposes, the terms are interchangeable. Thread A thread refers to a serial computational process which can run on a single core. The number of threads generated by a parallel job may exceed the number of cores available though, in which case cores may alternate between running different threads. Threads are a software concept whereas cores are physical hardware."},{"location":"Supplementary/Hostkeys/","title":"Hostkeys","text":"<p>These are the current hostkey fingerprints for our clusters.
